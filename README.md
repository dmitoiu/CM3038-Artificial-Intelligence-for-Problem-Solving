# CM3038: Artificial Intelligence for Problem-Solving

![](docs/fa3246798482f022d533d209a088fc09.png)

The **CM3038: Artificial Intelligence for Problem-Solving Project** is a console application designed to solve the **Bridge
and Torch Problem** using the **A*** Algorithm written in Java.
It supports Static and Dynamic User Input.

## Problem Definition

**The bridge and torch problem (also known as The Midnight Train and Dangerous crossing) is a logic puzzle that deals 
with four people, a bridge and a torch. It is in the category of river crossing puzzles, 
where a number of objects must move across a river, with some constraints.**

## Story

**Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, and it can only hold two people at a time. 
They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. 
Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. 
When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. 
The question is, can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?**
